Hi my name is Jeffery Townsend and I am currently working towards transitioning into the IT field with the goal of becoming either a network engineer or cybersecurity professional. I have been around computers my entire life and I love to play around with new technology as it comes along so i figured that I should get into the Industry so that i can feel like im getting paid to do the things that I have loved doing since I was a child while continuing to improve my skills.


## Objective

My journey into computer technology has led me to develop a passion for networking and cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically looking to become a Security Analyst!
