My name is Jeffery Townsend, and I’m currently working on transitioning into the IT field with the goal of becoming a network engineer or cybersecurity professional. I’m self-motivated and have recently fallen in love with the challenge of diving into the world of networking and security, as it has pushed me out of my comfort zone and shown me I can achieve things I once thought impossible. By studying and working on projects and labs, I’m aiming to gain enough experience to begin my professional journey.

## Objective

My journey into computer technology has led me to develop a passion for networking and cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically looking to become a Security Analyst!
